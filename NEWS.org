* Version 1.12.5
- Prevent duplicate tools in ellama-tools. Added a test function to add-to-list
  to check if a tool with the same name already exists before adding it to
  ellama-tools-available. This prevents duplicate tools from being registered
  when enabling tools by name.
- Update changelog skill quoting style. Changed the changelog generation skill
  to use org-mode quoting (~text~) instead of markdown backticks (`text`). Also
  use "MUST" instead of "must" to pay LLM's attention to the newline
  requirement.
* Version 1.12.4
- Normalize file path in write-file function. Added expand-file-name to properly
  handle both absolute and relative paths when writing files, preventing
  potential issues with file path resolution.

  uncallable function objects in the confirmation prompt.
- Make task tool unaccessible for general subagents. This change improves
  security and control over tool access.
- Fix file write tool. Corrected the order of operations in
  ellama-tools-write-file-tool by setting the buffer file name before inserting
  content.
- Fix async tools confirmation. Use callback function to return result to the
  agent.

  ellama-get-system-message to allow callers to provide custom system messages
  via the :system plist key. This allows sub-agents to use skills.
- Improve agent response result handling. Updated result encoding to return
  "done" for nil results instead of causing potential errors.
- Fix result handling in tool execution wrapper. Improved the logic for handling
  tool results by ensuring JSON encoding only occurs when a result exists. This
  change fixes async task execution.
* Version 1.12.3
- Improve loop control in confirmation dialog. Refactored the while loop in the
  confirmation prompt to use explicit t/nil returns for loop continuation
  instead of throw/catch. This improves code readability and maintainability
  while preserving all existing functionality.

  returns from project-current, making the function more robust when locating
  the AGENTS.md file.
* Version 1.12.0
- Add asynchronous task delegation functionality via the new ~task~ tool that
  allows delegating descriptions to subagents with custom roles and max-steps
  limits.

  customization variable, enabling custom providers, system prompts and tool
  access permissions for different agent types.

  files. Added support for configurable file extensions and utility functions to
  locate, read, and load blueprints from files. This provides a flexible,
  project-aware mechanism for discovering and loading blueprint resources.

  being previously required.
* Version 1.8.3
- Added ~ellama-debug~ custom variable to enable debug output. When enabled,
